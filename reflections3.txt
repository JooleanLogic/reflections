When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  When you have several people working on the same project.
  If you commute between various locations and can use the cloud for synching
  For backup of data in an online repository.


Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	To avoid any potential conflicts that new code may introduce into your own working copy.
