What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	It creates a subfolder called .git with initially no commits. You need to do it because otherwise there's no data in which git can compare and track modified files.

	
How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	The staging area is an intermediate place between the repository and the working directory. It is in the working directory but not yet in the repository.
	It's value is that it allows you to add only certain files to a commit operation.
